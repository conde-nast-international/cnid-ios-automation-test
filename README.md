# Overview

This repo contains the outline and materials related to the technical interview for the role of Mobile Automation QA at Cond√© Nast.

For this interview you have 2 options for the technical assesment. 

#1) A project where you will write XCUITests within an Xcode Test Suite

#2) A project where you will download an Android app apk and write a small Appium Test Suite. 

You may choose whichever of these options you feel best represents your skills! 

# Option 1: Write XCUITests within an Xcode Test Suite

During this exercise, the candidate and interviewer will pair programming on adding a new automation test suite to an existing iOS app.

## About the app:

The app we'll be adding UI test coverage to is a news app! It shows news article retrived from newsapi.org. It first shows a feed, and then allows you to click into an item in the feed for some expanded information. 

You can find the codebase for this app within this repo.

## The exercise:

As the test automation engineer, we'll be looking for you to layout a plan to add coverage to this app. Prepare to walk us through your recommendations for how to start and then expand upon an initial test suite.

During the exercise, we'll expect you to have Xcode up and and running the project, and be prepared to begin adding the new test suite. Make sure the project runs on your local machine please! And we'll be using Zoom w/ screen sharing turned on so we can all see what's happening.

# Option 2: Download an Android app apk and write a small Appium Test Suite

During this exercise, the candidate and interviewer will pair programming on adding a new automation test suite to an existing Android app using Appium.

## Getting the app:

Please grab an apk of your choice from the Google Play Store for a Conde Nast brand. One good choice is the Wired app.

## The exercise:

As the test automation engineer, we'll be looking for you to layout a plan to add coverage to this app. Prepare to walk us through your recommendations for how to start and then expand upon an initial test suite.

During the exercise, we'll expect you to have an IntelliJ or similar tool up and and running to begin an Appium test suite. Please be prepared to begin adding the new tests to this test suite. And we'll be using Zoom w/ screen sharing turned on so we can all see what's happening.
